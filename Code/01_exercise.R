#Create an object named a that represents a vector of 4 elements which includes the numbers 5 to 8 (both included).

#List the second element of the object

#List the fourth element of the object

#Multiply the second and the fourth element of the object


#Create a new object with the numbers 3 and 4. Call the object b. After that, use b to extract the third and fourth element of the object a.


#Extract all elements in a except for the second one. 

#Extract all elements in a except for the third and the fourth.

#Create a matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns. Do it in such a way that the first row includes numbers from 1 to 3, second row from 4 to 6
#and third row from 7 to 9.






#Extract the value in the second row, second column


#Extract AND LIST the value in the second row


#Extract and list all the values in the third column

#Convert the object created before (matrix) into a dataframe

#Extract the second observation in the second variable


#Extract all values from the second observation


#Extract all values in the third variable


#Create two ojects. One with 4 numbers and the other one with two 'characters'


#Use the function list() to create an object that consists of a list of the two previous objects


#Use the function names() to change the names of the sub-objects you have just created


#Create an object that contains a repetition of even numbers from 1 to 50
